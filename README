- **sli/**: Contains Prometheus rules for SLIs.
  - `sli_product_inbound.rules.yml`: Defines SLIs for inbound API requests.
  - `sli_product_oubound.rules.yml`: Defines SLIs for outbound API requests.
- **slo/**: Placeholder for SLO definitions.

## SLIs Overview

### Inbound SLIs
Defined in `sli/sli_product_inbound.rules.yml`:
- **Availability Ratio**: Measures the proportion of successful inbound requests.
- **Latency Ratio**: Measures the proportion of inbound requests completed within 300ms.
- **Error Rate**: Measures the proportion of failed inbound requests.

### Outbound SLIs
Defined in `sli/sli_product_oubound.rules.yml`:
- **Availability Ratio**: Measures the proportion of successful outbound requests.
- **Latency Ratio**: Measures the proportion of outbound requests completed within 300ms.
- **Error Rate**: Measures the proportion of failed outbound requests.

## How to Use

1. **Set Up Prometheus**: Ensure Prometheus is installed and configured in your environment.
2. **Load Rules**: Add the `.yml` files from the `sli/` directory to your Prometheus configuration.
3. **Monitor Metrics**: Use Prometheus to monitor the defined SLIs and visualize them in a dashboard (e.g., Grafana).

## Future Work

- Add SLO definitions in the `slo/` directory.
- Extend the framework to support additional metrics and services.
